 * @defgroup Ball Ball
 * A simple dynamic bouncing ball model based off the classic Trick tutorial 'ball' simulation.
 * @details These are models based off the simple Trick 'ball' tutorial.  We are using these
 * models to demonstrate the fundamentals of how to use TrickHLA to enable HLA-based
 * distributed simulation capabilities to a Trick-based simulation.  Here, we start with
 * SIM_ball_L3 since we know we want more than one ball in the federation execution.
