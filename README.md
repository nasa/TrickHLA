# TrickHLA is an IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Simulation Interoperability Middleware for the Trick Simulation Environment

The TrickHLA software supports the IEEE-1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) 
simulation interoperability standard for the 
[Trick Simulation Environment](https://github.com/nasa/trick/). The TrickHLA 
software abstracts away the details of using HLA, allowing the user to concentrate 
on the simulation and not worry about having to be an HLA distributed simulation 
expert. The TrickHLA software is data driven and provides a simple Application 
Programming Interface (API) making it relatively easy to take an existing Trick 
simulation and make it an HLA distributed simulation.

## Installing, Building, and Running:

These instructions will walk you through the process of installing TrickHLA on 
your computer. Instructions are also provided for building an example two 
Federate simulation and then running it.

### Dependencies

TrickHLA requires the Trick Simulation Environment and a fully compliant 
IEEE 1516-2010 Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) in order to function. 

1) Install the Trick Simulation Environment by following the [Trick Install Guide](https://nasa.github.io/trick/documentation/install_guide/Install-Guide).

2) Install an IEEE 1516-2010 RTI using the installer and instructions provided by the vendor.

### Getting TrickHLA
Clone TrickHLA from the master branch.

git clone https://github.com/nasa/TrickHLA.git

### Environment Setup

1) Define $TRICK_HOME to point to where you installed Trick.

2) Add $TRICK_HOME/bin to your $PATH.

3) Define $TRICKHLA_HOME to point to the TrickHLA clone directory.

4) Define $RTI_HOME to point to your RTI install directory.

5) Define $RTI_VENDOR to be one of either <i>Pitch_HLA_Evolved</i> or <i>MAK_HLA_Evolved</i> depending on the RTI you are using.

6) Optionally, define $RTI_JAVA_HOME to override the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by the RTI if it uses one.

### Building an Example Simulation

1) cd $TRICKHLA_HOME/sims/SpaceFOM/SIM_sine

2) trick-CP

### Running an Example Simulation

The sine wave example simulation is a two federate distributed simulation that 
solves a sine wave using both an analytic and a propagated solution. 
The [SISO SpaceFOM International Standard](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.sisostandards.org/resource/resmgr/standards_products/siso-std-018-2020_srfom.pdf) is used
in this example for execution control.

1) Make sure a fully compliant IEEE 1516-2010 RTI is running on the local host.

2) From a terminal, run the Analytic solution Federate:<br/>
./S_main*.exe RUN_a_side_mpr/input.py --verbose on

3) From a second terminal, run the Propagated solution Federate:<br/>
./S_main*.exe RUN_p_side/input.py --verbose on
