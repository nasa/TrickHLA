\section{Identification of Document}
This document provides a description of and an entry into the \TrickHLA
middleware model package.  As described above, \TrickHLA provides an interface
framework between Trick-based simulations and HLA-based distributed simulation
executions.  This document adheres to the documentation standards defined in
NASA Software Engineering Requirements Standard \cite{NASA:SWE}.

\section{Scope of Document}
This document is the top level document in a collection of documents that
provide information on the following aspects of \TrickHLA :
\begin{itemize}
\item requirements,
\item algorithms and design,
\item verification and validation, and
\item use
\end{itemize}
This includes references to associated texts and standards.

\section{Purpose and Objectives of Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough understanding of the
methods by which the \TrickHLA\ was defined, programmed, and verified.

\section{Documentation Status and Schedule}
The information in this document is current with the \TrickHLAid\ implementation
of the \TrickHLA\ modules.  Updates will be kept current with module changes.
