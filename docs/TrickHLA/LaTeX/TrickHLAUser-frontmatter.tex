\begin{abstract}
The \TrickHLA\ model provides an abstraction of the IEEE-1516 High Level
Architecture (HLA) in the Trick Simulation Environment allowing a
developer to concentrate on simulation development without needing to
be an HLA expert.
This document is a users guide for engineers and developers seeking to
use \TrickHLA\ in their simulations.
