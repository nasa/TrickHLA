\begin{abstract}
The \TrickHLA\ model provides a simplified interface to the
IEEE-1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) \cite{IEEE1516:API}
for use in the Trick Simulation Environment.
It allows developers to concentrate on simulation development
without needing to be an HLA expert.
The model is heavily data driven
and based on a simple API C++ making it relatively easy to take an existing
Trick simulation and make it HLA aware.
This document provides a high-level overview of the model.
