\chapter{Architectural Design}\label{sec:architectural_design}
The architectural model for this software is as defined in, and
required by, the Trick Simulation Environment.  The reader is urged
to examine references \cite{Vetter:TrickUTM} and \cite{Vetter:TrickVD}
for a thorough understanding of this programming environment.

\section{Definition of the \MODEL}

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
The \MODEL\ is a collection of functions that COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

This module is not a stand-alone program;
rather, it is designed to be incorporated into the Trick
Simulation Environment, and applies to space vehicles or objects that are
either docked to or undocked from one another.
Primary user(s) of this software are simulation and model developers
who wish to simulate spacecraft operations, including docking and
undocking procedures under nominal and emergency scenarios.

\subsection{Goals and Objectives}
The goal of the \MODEL\ is to COMPLETE THIS PARAGRAPH.


\chapter{Mathematical Formulations}\label{sec:math_formulations}
FILL IN THIS SECTION.
REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AS NEEDED.
REPRODUCE KEY EQUATIONS USED IN THE SOURCE CODE.
DO NOT DESCRIBE THE SOURCE CODE ITSELF YET, THAT COMES LATER.

\chapter{Interface Design}\label{sec:interface_design}

Trick simulations use enumerated types and data structures as the
primary inter-job interface mechanism and for input and output processing.

\section{Data Structure Design}

This section describes the \MODEL\ enumerated types and data structures.

CASE 1: MODEL HAS ONE HEADER FILE
The {\em MODEL.h} file contains COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
It contains the following enumerations and data structures:
\begin{description}

\item [ENUM1:] An enumeration of the COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [ENUMn:] An enumeration of the COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [STRUCT1:] A data structure containing COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [STRUCTn:] A data structure containing COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\end{description}

% \input{xml/MODEL.h.tex}
% \clearpage

CASE 2: MODEL HAS MULTIPLE HEADER FILE

This section describes the design of the data structures
defined in that file.

The data structures used in conjunction with the
\MODEL\ are defined in the following files:
\begin{description}
\item[MODEL1.h] - BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF MODEL1.h
\item[MODELn.h] - BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF MODELn.h
\end{description}

\subsection{MODEL1.h}

The {\em MODEL1.h} file contains COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
It contains the following enumerations and data structures:
\begin{description}

\item [ENUM1:] An enumeration of the COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [ENUMn:] An enumeration of the COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [STRUCT1:] A data structure containing COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\item [STRUCTn:] A data structure containing COMPLETE THIS FRAGMENT.
ADD NECESSARY DETAILS.

\end{description}

% \input{xml/MODEL1.h.tex}
% \clearpage

\subsection{MODELn.h}

REPEAT ABOVE.


\section{Input Files}

This section describes the default data files used to
initialize the \MODEL\ data structures.

FILL IN THIS SECTION.


\chapter{Functional Design}\label{sec:functional_design}

SAMPLE ONLY - ASSUMES MODEL\_init.c and MODEL.c

This section describes the functions that implement the \MODEL.

These functions are defined in
\begin{description}
\item[\texorpdfstring{\tt MODEL\_init.c}{MODEL\_init.c}] - Initializes model.
\item[\texorpdfstring{\tt MODEL.c}{MODEL.c}] - Updates model.
\end{description}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\tt MODEL\_init.c}{MODEL\_init.c}}

\subsection{Design}

DESCRIBE THE DESIGN OF THIS FILE. REFERENCE ANY MATH MODELS
DESCRIBED IN chapter \ref{sec:architectural_design} THAT
ARE USED IN THIS FUNCTION.
CAPTURE HIGH-LEVEL CONCEPTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE TRICK HEADER.

\subsection{Trick header}

% \input{xml/MODEL_init.tex}

\subsection{Requirements Traceability}

ENUMERATE THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE REQUIREMENTS
DOCUMENT THAT THIS FUNCTION SATISFIES.


\chapter{Version Description}\label{sec:versions}
This section identifies the versions of the
\MODEL\ described in the current release of the \MODEL\ documentation.

\section{Inventory}
The following items comprise the complete configuration-managed
inventory of the \MODEL:

LIST ALL FILES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODEL THAT ARE IN THE RAZOR DATABASE.

\section{Change Status}
This is the basic implementation of the software suite.  A change
status is not provided.

\section{Adaptation Data}
This is the first release (basic version) of the \MODEL\ software suite.
No adaptation data is appropriate or is provided, as the user will
define the ab initio data structures at initialization time.
