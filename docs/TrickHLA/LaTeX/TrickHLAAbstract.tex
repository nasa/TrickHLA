\begin{abstract}
\TrickHLA\ is a middleware model package that provides an interface
framework for enabling IEEE-1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) capabilities
in simulations developed in the Trick Simulation Environment. \TrickHLA\
allows a developer to concentrate on simulation development without needing
to be an HLA expert. The \TrickHLA\ model is data driven and provides a
simplified API making it relatively easy to take an existing Trick-based
simulation and make it HLA capable.
