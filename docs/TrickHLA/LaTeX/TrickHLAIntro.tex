The objective of \TrickHLA\ is to simplify the process of providing simulations
built with the Trick Simulation Environment\cite{Trick:Documentation} with
the ability to participate in distributed executions using the High Level
Architecture (HLA)\cite{IEEE1516:FRAMEWORK}.  This allows a simulation developer
to concentrate on the simulation and not have to be an HLA expert.
\TrickHLA\ is data driven and provides a simple API making it relatively easy
to take an existing Trick simulation and make it HLA capable.
