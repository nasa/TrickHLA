Execution specific text.  When complete, the document should not have any red

The Space Reference Federation Object Model (SpaceFOM) Federation Execution
Specific Federation Agreement (FESFA) is a document that provides specific
configuration data necessary to achieve interoperability based on the SpaceFOM.
Several rules in the SpaceFOM put requirements on what data need to be recorded
in the FESFA. This template establishes the standard format and content so that
all SpaceFOM FESFA products contain the same basic information and have the
same basic look.}
